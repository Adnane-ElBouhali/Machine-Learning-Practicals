# Machine Learning Practicals

This repository contains practical works completed during the "SD-TSIA210: Machine Learning" course in the second year at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

The course "SD-TSIA210: Machine Learning" focused on statistical learning for pattern recognition, prediction, and diagnosis within a probabilistic and statistical framework. Key topics included:

- Formulating supervised learning problems (classification and regression) as statistical criteria optimization problems
- Developing appropriate learning algorithms
- Evaluating constructed classification or regression functions

Main models and algorithms studied:
- Perceptron
- SVM/SVR
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods
- Generative Approaches
- Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

## Practical Works

This repository includes practical sessions on:

1. Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods
2. Neural Networks
3. Introduction to Generative AI

## Course Structure

The course was structured into 7 sessions:

1. Statistical learning: an introduction
2. Trees and ensemble methods
